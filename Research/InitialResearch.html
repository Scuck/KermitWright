<!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
<!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

            <p class="text-light">The most immediately obvious way to answer the question is merely with language, simply saying, or writing, what you believe the answer to be. This method is also prevalent with this question, with countless papers written on the topic of what exactly art is, each with specific opinions on the true role, classification, and nature of existence of art. There are endless examples of this, of one arguing that art is all in the observation, only for the retort to be that art is contained entirely within the creation. However, it is nearly impossible to write one off as wrong and claim another as correct, as each potential answer simply asserts their own answer as true, because creating a proof is simply impossible. Hence, a problem presents itself.</p>
            <h4 class="text-light">If no answer can be deemed correct, incorrect, or in any way superior to another answer, how can any answer hold meaning?</h4>

          <div class="col-md-1"></div>
          <div class="col border border-info">
            <h4 class="text-light">If no singular answer for the question of ‘What is Art’ can answer the question in its entirety, if art cannot be pinned down to a singular, definable thing, then to answer the question, a similarly formless method of answer is required.</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="text-light">When the problem of answering the question is posed in this way, a solution immediately reveals itself. If no singular, complete answer can answer the question because art cannot be any singular thing, then art itself, in its fluidity, is a perfect match for the fluidity of the question.

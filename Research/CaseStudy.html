                <p class="text-light"><i>Fountain</i> by Marcel Duchamp is both a perfect example of art being used to investigate the question of ‘What is Art’ and one of the classic pieces in this field, which has inspired many other artists to follow suit, making pieces of art that ask their own questions as well. <i>Fountain</i> is a ready-made sculpture, meaning it is a sculpture not created, but presented by the artist, and the importance of this piece extends from its placement as a piece of art. Through this mechanism, <i>Fountain</i> evokes the question of “is this art” in nearly every one who sees it, and each person who sees it can come to their own conclusion, ranging from “no, it's just a toilet” to “sure, why not?”, and with this method of outsourcing the question to the observer, <i>Fountain</i> succeeds in creating a complete answer to the question by interrogating its audience. If there is any way in which <i>Fountain</i> failed, it is likely in its reach, as many immediately dismissed the artwork, such as philosopher John Passmore who called <i>Fountain</i> “a piece of mischief at the expense of the art world”.</p>
